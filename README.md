## The Story

[3-sentence paragraph generated and then edited by you.]

## How the Data Was Collected

[Describe your digitization app and how you got coordinates → radii → areas.]

## The Math and Visualization

- Briefly explain that you used distances from the center to compute radii.
- Mention that areas are proportional to r².
- Note that each wedge encodes deaths from different causes.

## The Visualization

## Key Insights

- [Bullet about the left diagram (before reforms).]
- [Bullet about the right diagram (after reforms).]
- [Bullet about what this shows about data and policy change.]
- [Your own extra observation.]

## Technical Details

- Language: Python  
- Libraries: [list your main libraries]  
- Files:
  - `src/digitize_app.py`  
  - `src/plot_rose.py`  
  - `data/coordinates.json`  
  - `data/nightingale_computed.csv`  

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional).  
3. Install requirements (if you have a `requirements.txt`).  
4. Run the plotting script:  
   `python src/plot_rose.py`  

## What I Learned
